# PROGRESS JOURNAL (append-only; newest last; next session reads the tail)

## 2026-07-21 — harness bootstrap
- Session history to date: V11 frozen baseline honored -> V13 MC built -> park factors data-derived
  (1,505-final backfill) -> sides verdict DEAD at n=1461 (MC ~coin .2500/53%, GBM worse .2563) ->
  K-props validated in backtest (n=1759, calibrated, MAE 1.92) -> forward paper ledger opened.
- Today: built harness (AGENTS.md, state.json, healthcheck, runbook) per Anthropic/OpenAI
  harness-engineering articles. 7/21 K-prop card sent (4 paper plays: Rasmussen O4.5, Buehler O3.5
  full-weight; Perkins O4.5, Mikolas O2.5 half-weight). Grade scheduled 05:30Z.
- Caught-bug log: relief-outing TBF inflation in K projections (fixed: start-only). Keep R5 sharp.
- For next session: run postgame cycle for 7/21, then pregame 7/22. E1 (opponent-K%) is the queued
  experiment when there's capacity.

## 2026-07-22 (early) — DURABILITY INCIDENT + full harness live
- INCIDENT: container rollback silently erased the 7/19-20 grading turn's writes (results upsert,
  kprops engine, 7/21 card files). Healthcheck CAUGHT IT on first run. Repaired from conversation
  record: results.csv back to 1,505 finals (verified in separate process), kprops.py rebuilt and
  reproduces carded projections exactly (Rasmussen 5.41/Buehler 4.41/Perkins 5.83/Mikolas 3.75).
  New rule in force: git commit after EVERY write batch. Recommend a remote to Taco for true durability.
- HARNESS LIVE: AGENTS.md entry point, state.json (verdicts/ledgers/gates/experiment queue),
  healthcheck, runbook. Recurring tasks created: PREGAME daily 15:00 UTC (card -> Taco),
  POSTGAME daily 05:30 UTC (grade + dataset + ledger). Both fresh-session, bootstrap via AGENTS.md.
- Pending tonight: 4 kprop paper plays grade at next postgame fire (~05:35Z).

## 2026-07-22 (manual postgame, user-triggered)
- 7/21 graded: Rasmussen WIN (5K, proj 5.41 — nailed), Buehler LOSS (3K vs 4.41), Perkins LOSS (4K vs 4.5, near-miss), Mikolas VOID (gs=0, relief — book rules void no-start props). Day 1: 1-2-1V, -0.47u.
- 13 finals + 2 PPD (PIT@NYY, BAL@BOS -> likely 7/22 DHs) upserted; dataset 1518 finals. Pitcher logs appended (ER/BB placeholders noted).
- 05:30Z trigger will find work done; should no-op gracefully.

## 2026-07-22 (midday) — board priced
- Taco posted RotoWire K board + odds. 4 paper plays: Cole U6.5(-105), Singer U5.5(-144), Jump O4.5(+104), Bennett U5.5(-148, half). Pending in state.json.
- Detmers/Kremer overs correctly declined (prices pre-shaded steep toward our projections — E3 note).
- Starter changes vs morning probables: Lauer, Dobbins, Fried, Kay, Quantrill, Miles, Perez, Hughes.

## 2026-07-23 (manual postgame for 7/22)
- K-props day 2: Jump WIN (5K>4.5, +110), Bennett WIN (4K<5.5), Cole LOSS (11K!! vs proj 5.59 — biggest miss yet), Singer LOSS (6K vs 4.46). Day -0.56u; cumulative 3-4-1V, -1.03u (hand-math error caught+fixed, corrections entry); gate 7/100 (Mikolas VOID does not count).
- ML tracking day 1: 3-1 (MIL✓ BOS✓ KC✓ | SEA✗).
- Cole 11K vs proj 5.59 = 5.4K miss on a 19-start sample -> E1 (opponent-K%) escalated: PIT strikes out a LOT; opponent adjustment would have raised Cole's proj + possibly flipped the play. Priority experiment.
- Dataset 1,535 finals. Logs appended.

## 2026-07-23 (midday) — selection-logic fix + Sale registered
- Taco caught best-EV-first flaw: qualifying U7.5@HR quote masked by non-qualifying max-EV U6.5@FD. Engine gains select_play() (qualify-then-best). Sale U7.5 -145 HR 1.0u registered pre-pitch (E[K] 6.54, disp -0.96, edge +7pp). Official 7/23 engine card = Sale U7.5 + Seymour O4.5. Taco 5-play raw baseline unchanged, grades in parallel.

## 2026-07-23 (audit closeout, per Taco)
- Sale log corruption CONFIRMED (phantom rows) -> 6 logs re-fetched verbatim; Sale now 18GS/123SO/426TBF matching external EXACTLY (+ tonight's start). Other 5 flagged = legit openers, not corruption.
- Healthcheck gains log-integrity rule (dupe dates / consecutive >3IP starts). price_cli.py is now the mandated board->plays caller (wires select_play mechanically). progress gate-count corrected (7/100, voids excluded).

## 2026-07-23 (late) — reconciliation protocol adopted (Taco spec)
- StatMuse route VERIFIED fetchable; confirms Sale repair (5/20+5/28 real, 5/22+5/27 phantom; 123 K).
- Healthcheck: spacing now FLAGS for reconciliation (warn) instead of hard-fail; opener-aware; never auto-delete.
- Runbook: full repair protocol + quarantine rule + 8-field forward format (adds opponent).

## 2026-07-24 (postgame for 7/23)
- ENGINE K-props 1-1, -0.58u: Seymour O4.5 WIN (7K), Sale U7.5 LOSS (11K vs proj 6.54). Cumulative 4-5, -1.61u; gate 9/100.
- Sale 11K = SECOND straight day an elite-K arm torched our UNDER (Cole 11K 7/22). Both disp<1.0, both book-info not book-error. E1 (opponent-K%) now TOP priority — SD/PIT are high-K offenses the model is blind to.
- TACO raw baseline 3-2, +0.48u vs engine -0.58u — but the divergence is subtler than "discipline too tight": the 4 plays the engine declined/skipped went 2-2 (Williams W, Dobnak W, Bradley L, McGreevy L) = -0.36u flat. Filters were NET-CORRECT (declining Bradley -153 juice + McGreevy no-disp AVOIDED 2 losses; only Williams was a true shrinkage-cost-a-winner, elite-K arm pulled 0.75->0.47). Baseline's profit came from the SHARED Seymour play (+0.84 full vs engine +0.42 half). Engine lost the night PURELY on its unique Sale play. A/B night-1 Brier raw 0.244 < shrunk 0.258 (n=4, noise).
- ML tracking 2-1 (MIN✓ +112 upset, ATL✓, STL✗). Cumulative 5-2. V13 dir 3-2 -> 21-12.
- Dataset: 1,539 finals (7/23 upserted; ARI@STL already present). Logs: 9 starts appended + Sale 7/23 placeholder corrected (3.2|7K -> 6.0|11K); Sale season now 19GS/134SO/450TBF = external EXACTLY.
- BUG: runbook 8-field forward log format crashes sp_asof (field[1] parsed as IP). Reverted to 7-field; parser needs opp-aware len==8 branch before adoption. Logged to known_issues.
